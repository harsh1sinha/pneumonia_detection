# Detecting Pneumonia from Chest X-Rays

This project uses deep learning to classify chest X-ray images into two categories: **Normal** and **Pneumonia**. The model is built using TensorFlow and leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.

##  Project Structure

The notebook is organized into the following main sections:

1. **Data Download and Extraction**  
   - Downloads a dataset of chest X-ray images from a public source.
   - Extracts the ZIP archive containing the dataset.

2. **Imports and Setup**  
   - Imports necessary libraries: TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pathlib.
   - Sets random seed for reproducibility.

3. **Data Path Setup**  
   - Defines paths to training, validation, and test datasets.

4. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**  
   - Collects image paths and converts them into a list of strings.
   - Extracts labels from image paths (Normal: 0, Pneumonia: 1).
   - Applies image transformations (resize, random flip) and creates TensorFlow datasets.

5. **Model Building**  
   - Defines a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras (not shown in the provided snippet, but implied).

6. **Training and Evaluation**  
   - Trains the model on the training dataset.
   - Evaluates performance on the validation set.

7. **Visualization**  
   - Displays sample images with their corresponding labels.

##  Dataset

The dataset is organized into three directories:

- `chest_xray/train/` – Training images
- `chest_xray/val/` – Validation images
- `chest_xray/test/` – Test images

Each directory contains two subfolders:
- `NORMAL/`
- `PNEUMONIA/`

##  Model

The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to classify X-ray images. It includes:

- Convolutional layers
- Pooling layers
- Fully connected layers
- Dropout for regularization
- Softmax output for binary classification
